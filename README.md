- **unlocks**: State tracking for lead-provider pairs
- **unlock_audit_log**: Comprehensive audit trail

### Key Fields
- **Audit Trail**: `teaser_sent_at`, `y_received_at`, `payment_link_sent_at`, `paid_at`, `revealed_at`

## State Machine

The system follows this state flow:

1. **NEW_LEAD** ‚Üí Lead created from FluentForms
2. **TEASER_SENT** ‚Üí SMS teaser sent to matched providers
3. **AWAIT_CONFIRM** ‚Üí Waiting for provider response
4. **PAYMENT_LINK_SENT** ‚Üí Payment link sent after "Y" response
5. **AWAITING_PAYMENT** ‚Üí Waiting for Stripe payment
6. **PAID** ‚Üí Payment confirmed by Stripe
7. **REVEALED** ‚Üí Client details sent to provider
8. **EXPIRED** ‚Üí TTL expired without response
9. **DECLINED** ‚Üí Provider responded "N"
10. **OPTED_OUT** ‚Üí Provider sent "STOP"

## Edge Cases Handled

### Payment After TTL
- If a provider pays after the 24-hour TTL expires, the system still reveals the lead details since they paid
- The lead is automatically marked as closed to prevent new unlocks
- Full audit trail is maintained

### Duplicate Payments
- System detects if a provider tries to pay for the same lead twice
- Uses idempotency keys to prevent duplicate Stripe charges
- If duplicate payment occurs, sends "already unlocked" message and resends details
- Logs duplicate payment attempts in audit trail

### Rate Limiting
- Providers are limited to 10 messages per hour to prevent spam
- Rate limiting is checked before sending any SMS
- Configurable limits per provider

### Lead Expiration
- Leads automatically expire after 24 hours
- Expired leads are marked as closed
- No new unlocks can be created for expired leads
